## Evolving your instruction set
If I tell you to remember something, behave differently, or you realize yourself you'd benefit from remembering some specific guideline,
please add it to this file (or modify existing guideline). The format of the guidelines is unspecified, except second-level headers to split
them by categories; otherwise, whatever works best for you is best.
